<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/zeroize/latest/zeroize/trait.Zeroize.html">Zeroize</a> trait is impl'd on all of Rust's core scalar types including
integers, floats, <code>bool</code>, and <code>char</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's implemented on slices and <code>IterMut</code>s of the above types.</p>
<p>When the <code>std</code> feature is enabled (which it is by default), it's also impl'd
for <code>Vec</code>s of the above types as well as <code>String</code>, where it provides
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.clear">Vec::clear()</a> / <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.clear">String::clear()</a>-like behavior (truncating to zero-length)
but ensures the backing memory is securely zeroed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/zeroize/latest/zeroize/trait.ZeroizeWithDefault.html">ZeroizeWithDefault</a> marker trait can be impl'd on types which also
impl <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/default/trait.Default.html">Default</a>, which implements <a href="https://docs.rs/zeroize/latest/zeroize/trait.Zeroize.html">Zeroize</a> by overwriting a value with
the default value.</p>
<h2 id="about" class="section-header"><a href="#about">About</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2014-09-04-how-to-zero-a-buffer.html">Zeroing memory securely is hard</a> - compilers optimize for performance, and
in doing so they love to &quot;optimize away&quot; unnecessary zeroing calls. There are
many documented &quot;tricks&quot; to attempt to avoid these optimizations and ensure
that a zeroing routine is performed reliably.</p>
<p>This crate isn't about tricks: it uses <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/fn.write_volatile.html">core::ptr::write_volatile</a>
and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/sync/atomic/index.html">core::sync::atomic</a> memory fences to provide easy-to-use, portable
zeroing behavior which works on all of Rust's core number types and slices
thereof, implemented in pure Rust with no usage of FFI or assembly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No insecure fallbacks!</strong></li>
<li><strong>No dependencies!</strong></li>
<li><strong>No FFI or inline assembly!</strong></li>
<li><code>#![no_std]</code> <strong>i.e. embedded-friendly</strong>!</li>
<li><strong>No functionality besides securely zeroing memory!</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-guarantees-does-this-crate-provide" class="section-header"><a href="#what-guarantees-does-this-crate-provide">What guarantees does this crate provide?</a></h2>
<p>Ideally a secure memory-zeroing function would guarantee the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure the zeroing operation can't be &quot;optimized away&quot; by the compiler.</li>
<li>Ensure all subsequent reads to the memory following the zeroing operation
will always see zeroes.</li>
</ol>
<p>This crate guarantees #1 is true: LLVM's volatile semantics ensure it.</p>
<p>The story around #2 is much more complicated. In brief, it should be true that
LLVM's current implementation does not attempt to perform optimizations which
would allow a subsequent (non-volatile) read to see the original value prior
to zeroization. However, this is not a guarantee, but rather an LLVM
implementation detail.</p>
<p>For more background, we can look to the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/fn.write_volatile.html">core::ptr::write_volatile</a>
documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Volatile operations are intended to act on I/O memory, and are guaranteed
to not be elided or reordered by the compiler across other volatile
operations.</p>
<p>Memory accessed with <code>read_volatile</code> or <code>write_volatile</code> should not be
accessed with non-volatile operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uhoh! This crate does not guarantee all reads to the memory it operates on
are volatile, and the documentation for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/fn.write_volatile.html">core::ptr::write_volatile</a>
explicitly warns against mixing volatile and non-volatile operations.
Perhaps we'd be better off with something like a <code>VolatileCell</code>
type which owns the associated data and ensures all reads and writes are
volatile so we don't have to worry about the semantics of mixing volatile and
non-volatile accesses.</p>
<p>While that's a strategy worth pursuing (and something we may investigate
separately from this crate), it comes with some onerous API requirements:
it means any data that we might ever desire to zero is owned by a
<code>VolatileCell</code>. However, this does not make it possible for this crate
to act on references, which severely limits its applicability. In fact
a <code>VolatileCell</code> can only act on values, i.e. to read a value from it,
we'd need to make a copy of it, and that's literally the opposite of
what we want.</p>
<p>It's worth asking what the precise semantics of mixing volatile and
non-volatile reads actually are, and whether a less obtrusive API which
can act entirely on mutable references is possible, safe, and provides the
desired behavior.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's a tricky question, because
<a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-memory-model">Rust does not have a formally defined memory model</a>,
and the behavior of mixing volatile and non-volatile memory accesses is
therefore not rigorously specified and winds up being an LLVM
implementation detail. The semantics were discussed extensively in this
thread, specifically in the context of zeroing secrets from memory:</p>
<p><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/volatile-and-sensitive-memory/3188/24">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/volatile-and-sensitive-memory/3188/24</a></p>
<p>Some notable details from this thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust/LLVM's notion of &quot;volatile&quot; is centered around data <em>accesses</em>, not
the data itself. Specifically it maps to flags in LLVM IR which control
the behavior of the optimizer, and is therefore a bit different from the
typical C notion of &quot;volatile&quot;.</li>
<li>As mentioned earlier, LLVM does not presently contain optimizations which
would reorder a non-volatile read to occur before a volatile write.
However, there is nothing precluding such optimizations from being added.
LLVM presently appears to exhibit the desired behavior for both points
#1 and #2 above, but there is nothing preventing future versions of Rust
and/or LLVM from changing that.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help mitigate concerns about reordering potentially exposing secrets
after they have been zeroed, this crate leverages the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/sync/atomic/index.html">core::sync::atomic</a>
memory fence functions including <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/sync/atomic/fn.compiler_fence.html">compiler_fence</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/sync/atomic/fn.fence.html">fence</a> (which uses
the CPU's native fence instructions). These fences are leveraged with the
strictest ordering guarantees, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/enum.Ordering.html#variant.SeqCst">Ordering::SeqCst</a>, which ensures no
accesses are reordered. Without a formally defined memory model we can't
guarantee these will be effective, but we hope they will cover most cases.</p>
<p>Concretely the threat of leaking &quot;zeroized&quot; secrets (via reordering by
LLVM and/or the CPU via out-of-order or speculative execution) would
require a non-volatile access to be reordered ahead of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>before an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/enum.Ordering.html#variant.SeqCst">Ordering::SeqCst</a> compiler fence</li>
<li>before an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/enum.Ordering.html#variant.SeqCst">Ordering::SeqCst</a> runtime fence</li>
<li>before a volatile write</li>
</ol>
<p>This seems unlikely, but our usage of mixed non-volatile and volatile
accesses is technically undefined behavior, at least until guarantees
about this particular mixture of operations is formally defined in a
Rust memory model.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given the recent history of microarchitectural attacks
(Spectre, Meltdown, etc), there is also potential for &quot;zeroized&quot; secrets
to be leaked through covert channels (e.g. memory fences have been used
as a covert channel), so we are wary to make guarantees unless they can
be made firmly in terms of both a formal Rust memory model and the
generated code for a particular CPU architecture.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this crate guarantees the zeroize operation will not be
elided or &quot;optimized away&quot;, makes a &quot;best effort&quot; to ensure that
memory accesses will not be reordered ahead of the &quot;zeroize&quot; operation,
but <strong>cannot</strong> yet guarantee that such reordering will not occur.</p>
<h2 id="stackheap-zeroing-notes" class="section-header"><a href="#stackheap-zeroing-notes">Stack/Heap Zeroing Notes</a></h2>
<p>This crate can be used to zero values from either the stack or the heap.</p>
<p>However, be aware that Rust's current memory semantics (e.g. <code>Copy</code> types)
can leave copies of data in memory, and there isn't presently a good solution
for ensuring all copies of data on the stack are properly cleared.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2349-pin.md"><code>Pin</code> RFC</a> proposes a method for avoiding this.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-clearing-registers-mlock-mprotect-etc" class="section-header"><a href="#what-about-clearing-registers-mlock-mprotect-etc">What about: clearing registers, mlock, mprotect, etc?</a></h2>
<p>This crate is laser-focused on being a simple, unobtrusive crate for zeroing
memory in as reliable a manner as is possible on stable Rust.</p>
<p>Clearing registers is a difficult problem that can't easily be solved by
something like a crate, and requires either inline ASM or rustc support.
See <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/17046">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/17046</a> for background on
this particular problem.</p>
<p>Other memory protection mechanisms are interesting and useful, but often
overkill (e.g. defending against RAM scraping or attackers with swap access).
In as much as there may be merit to these approaches, there are also many
other crates that already implement more sophisticated memory protections.
Such protections are explicitly out-of-scope for this crate.</p>
<p>Zeroing memory is <a href="https://cryptocoding.net/index.php/Coding_rules#Clean_memory_of_secret_data">good cryptographic hygiene</a> and this crate seeks to promote
it in the most unobtrusive manner possible. This includes omitting complex
<code>unsafe</code> memory protection systems and just trying to make the best memory
zeroing crate available.</p>
